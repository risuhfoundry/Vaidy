## 📖 Overview

India has 1.4 billion people and a significant gap between medical knowledge and patients. Lab reports arrive full of jargon, reference ranges are context-free, and most people have no easy way to understand what their own health data means.

**Vaidy** bridges that gap. It acts as a personal health intelligence layer — reading any diagnostic report you upload, building a longitudinal health timeline, detecting trends across visits, and answering your questions in plain language. Supports all major Indian diagnostic labs including Apollo, Thyrocare, Lal Path Labs, Dr. Lal and 50+ more.

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Animations
- **Particle Field** — Uses a seeded pseudo-random number generator so particles render identically on server and client (no hydration mismatch)
- **Shimmer Border** — CSS `::before` pseudo-element with animated `background-position` creates a traveling light effect on the upload card
- **Glow Orbs** — Layered `float` and `wave` animations create organic, depth-of-field-like background motion in the hero
- **Typewriter Effect** — `useEffect` interval drives character-by-character text reveal with regex-based keyword highlighting

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have `focus-visible` ring styles
- Decorative SVGs marked `aria-hidden="true"`
- Mobile navigation toggle has `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`
- Timeline rendered as a semantic `<ol>` with `<article>` cards

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The project is deployed on **Vercel** via automatic GitHub integration.

To deploy your own instance:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from the frontend directory
cd frontend
vercel
```

Or connect your fork to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) for automatic deployments on every push to `main`.
